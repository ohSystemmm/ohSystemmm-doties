  <summary>Requirements</summary>
<br>
The dotfiles are compatible with virtually any low-end device capable of running Hyprland. The primary requirement is an Arch Linux installation; while a fresh installation is preferred, it is not strictly necessary. A stable network connection is recommended, and you should also allocate some time for the installation process. The ohSystemmm-doties will automatically install the necessary packages required for the dotfiles to function properly.

  <summary>Installation</summary>

### Installation
Be sure to back up your own configurations, as they may be overwritten. It's recommended to install these dotfiles on a fresh Arch installation without a desktop environment, though they should also work on an existing setup. The included Install script will provide guidance and instructions throughout the installation process. Also, make sure to run the script in a bare TTY. (Ctrl + Alt + F3/F4/...)
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ohSystemmm/ohSystemmm-doties.git
$ cd ohSystemmm-doties/Action-Area.d/
$ ./Install.sh
```
After successfully installing, be sure to explore the ~/ohSystemmm-doties/Control.sh file. Run it to set your wallpaper, system design, and more.
